## [trencher.sc](./trencher.sc)
This is a script to spawn n amount of bots in a line to make digging the bottom trench for a trencher easier.

#### Usage [trencher.sc](./trencher.sc)
**Commands:**
- `/trencher spawn X Y Z 'NAME' COUNT YAW PITCH 'DIRECTION'` (Strings (Words, not numbers) need to be placed inside `''`. I will fix it as soon as possible.
- `/trencher kill 'NAME' COUNT` (bots die immediately)
- `/trencher jump 'NAME' COUNT` (bots jump once)
- `/trencher move 'NAME' COUNT` (bots start moving forward)
- `/trencher stop 'NAME' COUNT` (bots stop everything)
- `/trencher attack 'NAME' COUNT` (bots start to attack continous)
- `/trencher dropall 'NAME' COUNT` (bots drop all items and die immediately)
- `/trencher info` (displays some info about this command and it's usage)
